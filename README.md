# Study platform
## University study platform built with an SQL-based relational database and JavaFX GUI framework

This project is the implementation of a university study platform. The app uses an SQL relational database to store information regarding various university activities. User interaction is carried out through a graphical user interface. Functionalities include managing students and professors, as well as coordinating tasks within study programs.<br><br>

## Login
The application can be accessed, following an authentication process, by multiple types of users: students, professors, and administrators. For each user, personal information such as first name, last name, address, phone number, etc., is stored. Users can view their personal data immediately after logging in, but they do not have the ability to modify it. The application also provides a logout functionality, which returns to the login screen, allowing another user to access the system without restarting the application.

## Administrator
The administrators can add, modify, and delete user information in the database. Additionally, there is a super-administrator role, which has the ability to manage administrator users as well. Administrators can search for users by name and filter them by type. They can also assign professors to courses and search for courses by name.
